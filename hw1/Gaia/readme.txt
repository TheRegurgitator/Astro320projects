Here is my HW1 assignment.

I had trouble connecting my student github account, so I put this on my personal one. Also, after 4 hours of trying different
things to get SIMBAD to find more than 2/107 stars on my HMSOutput, I have given up. I included a Capture.png of my progress as of the due
date and time, and the only real advancements I made since then were converting the RA and DEC into hours minutes seconds,
printing that, and graphing using hours instead of degrees.
